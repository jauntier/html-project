    <h2><b>THE VIDEO DIARY</b></h2>
    <!-- the preamble -->
    <p><mark>Morgan (19-03-24, <em>21:30</em>):</mark> I made a promise to myself that I would travel the world more deliberately this decade and I have not failed myself yet :).</p>
    <br>
    <p><mark>Morgan (19-03-24, <em>21:36</em>):</mark> I shouldn't make that claim unless I have proof of it, should I?</p>
    <br>
    <p><mark>Nolan (19-03-24, <em>21:40</em>):</mark> Of course not, Morgan. We need receipts. (That's a lie; we're just too bored to forfeit your kind offer of receipts.)</p>
    <br>
    <p><mark>Leilani (19-03-24, <em>21:50</em>):</mark> Speak for yourself, Nolan. A pictureless vacation is vacationless as well.</p>
    <br>
    <p><mark>Morgan (19-03-24, <em>22:00</em>):</mark> Lucky for you guys, I've had one long decade :).</p>
